LED Patterns Project for LPC2148 (ARM7)

This project demonstrates three LED patterns using the LPC2148 microcontroller (ARM7):

1. SOS Signal: Implements the SOS Morse code pattern using LED blinks.
2. Binary Counter: Displays a 3-bit binary counter using 3 LEDs.
3. Night Rider Effect: Creates a scanning effect by blinking LEDs in a sequence.

Features:

- Bare-metal programming in C
- GPIO configuration and control
- Timing logic using software delays
- Reusable functions for LED control and delay

Hardware Requirements:

- LPC2148 microcontroller (ARM7)
- 3 LEDs connected to GPIO pins (P0.10, P0.11, P0.12)
- Resistors and common ground

Software Requirements:

- Keil IDE for ARM7 development
